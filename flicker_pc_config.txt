FLICKER PC - CONFIRMED WORKING SETTINGS
==============================================

Based on diagnostic output from diagnose_flicker.bat

OBS VIRTUAL CAMERA SETTINGS:
  Source: 1
  Backend: MSMF
  Resolution: 1080p
  FOURCC: auto

EXPLANATION:
- Source 0 = Laptop camera (640x480 @ 30fps)
- Source 1 = OBS Virtual Camera (1920x1080 @ 30fps) ← USE THIS
- Source 2 = USB Video device (640x480)

DSHOW BACKEND DOESN'T WORK:
All DSHOW sources report 0fps, indicating the backend
is not functioning properly with this OpenCV build.

Use MSMF backend exclusively on this PC.

TESTED: 2025-10-17
OBS VERSION: 32.0.1
PYTHON: 3.12.10
OPENCV: 4.12.0

NOTES:
- No flickering detected in diagnostic
- All sources reported as STABLE
- OpenCV name-based detection broken (normal for some builds)
- MSMF backend works, DSHOW does not

TO USE THESE SETTINGS:
1. Open Boot Cycle Logger
2. Set Source = 1
3. Set Backend = MSMF
4. Click "Connect to Camera"
5. Verify you see OBS feed (not laptop camera)
